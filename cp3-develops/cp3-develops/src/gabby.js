                In August of 2021 Gabby went missing. September 19, 2021 is the date <br/> human
                remains
                consistent with her description was found. The disappearance <br/> of Gabby sparked a
                national interest and an unofficial campaign was underway.<br/> How was
                she found so
                quick? Maybe, it was partly due to the power of the <br/>interWebs and people with a
                thirst for real life crime and drama, with skills <br/>to become what is known as an
                Internet Sleuth.
